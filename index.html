      <p class="story">Every day starts differently as I progress on with
my pregnancy and changes to my daily routine. I’ll
wake up around 6.30 each morning, leave the
house at 7.15 to catch the 7.57 train from
Waterloo. I reach university for 8.45 when I’ll grab
a quick snack and drink before a full day of
lectures begin. The lectures are interesting as I
train to be a teacher but it can be difficult when the
tiredness and pregnancy symptoms play up. I
leave university around 4.30 and reach home for
6.15 after which I’ll get dinner ready for my
husband and his family. Prepare lunch for the next
and make sure everyone’s had a hot drink before
sleeping. I normally leave the kitchen around 8.30
once everything’s been cleared up. Will spend

some time with my in laws followed by going to my room to get directed tasks from university
completed or then planning finished when I’m on placement. I’m not far from completing my
primary PGCE now and I’m excited to become a mother and teach other children soon after.</p>

      <p class="story">This morning I got up at 6.00 and headed to the local pool for a morning swim. I return home, shower, eat a quick breakfast and get on the train to make it to my first lecture at 9.00. I study Economics and Psychology, which I love as it gives me a real mix of understanding how the economy works but also looking deeper at why people act in certain ways and participate in the economy. Todays topic looked at Tax Evasion, trying to understand why people evade and why people comply. My classes finished at 2.00, so I get back on the train and head to work, to start at 3. I work as a business administrator at a swim school, where I aide with the finances, timetable classes and communication with clients. I finish work at 7.00, get my self home for dinner, do a final bit of study before heading to bed ready for another day.

          <p class="story"> I left my hotel room that at around 7 am and took a taxi to the heliport. We were given the usual basic offshore survival and emergency training. Then it was time to suit up in the heavy survival gear and shortly after that, we boarded the helicopter and took off.
            I smiled in awe as the offshore rig came into view from my window and after landing, I headed to the reception and checked into my room. I met up with my colleague who had been on board and discussed the job. There was a storm coming and drilling was postponed. With not much to do, I headed to the gym for 45 minutes then met up with the team for a buffet lunch. I always love offshore food as its excellent and better than my cooking. The storm was now upon us and the rig was swaying gently, we went to the cinema and watched a movie. Much sooner it was dinnertime and afterwards I relaxed on the massage chair for an hour and by 8pm, I was in bed knowing that the next would be much busier after the storm. </p>

            <p class="story">Summer is my favourite time of the year, this is partly because every summer I work for an amazing
organisation called “The Challenge”. It’s an organisation working with 16-18- year olds to build skills
for work and life whilst taking on new challenges. Kind of like a fun summer school, my role involved
managing groups of young people as they went through the programme. On this particular day, in
summer 2017, I got up extra early as we had planned a full day hike. We got ready, had breakfast,
packed our bags, collected our equipment, went over our route and set off on the hike just after
8:00am. The morning started off with beautiful clear blue skies, perfect water for the challenges we
had to do during our hike. However, just before reaching our campsite, the skies greyed up and we
were on a race against time to get our tents put up before we were all soaked. The rain lasted for a
good few hours, but it soon cleared into a double rainbow, overlooking the Somerset coastline. It was
just in time for us to cook our packet ready meal dinners, and around the fire, with our hot cholate and
marshmallows. It was perfect.</p>

                  <p class="story">My days blur into one: classes, placements, work, gym. But time is still when I'm chasing the sun; when it rises, when it sets. The only miracle I witness that keeps the spark alight in my heart. Where am I in life right now? Still yearning to cross the seas, and escape the buildings, the dullness, the monotony I have lived every day in this city, this town for the past 23 years. How is it when I look across the sea I feel such peace and such contentment, but this odd feeling of my soul escaping me -this world is not where you belong. I'm going crazy and feeling this strange serenity at once, trying to be present but not seeing the worth.
Snapping back to reality, I’m currently back at Jaguar temporarily, till I complete my second degree (South Asian parents don't ever seem to be satisfied), and become a trainee lawyer. It's different this time around, I receive treatment that I did not have when I was there full time as part of the sales team. My manager is like a different person, but of course, he is primarily a salesman, I can't forget that. It's amusing to remember when I would stare at him blankly, as he would try to get through to me in his bursts of frustrations, and would get further frustrated with my blankness. It was good to see young James again, and hear him moaning about the workplace. Lovely and amazing George gifted me two books, which I am so grateful for, and very much looking forward to reading. I've got quite the stack of 'to-read' books now, but of course I have a mountain of Law textbooks that my head should be buried very deeply into, with no hope of coming out, ever.

                        country where as a teacher I work hard on the weekdays and my weekends are luxurious and always
                        exciting. Like most of the Middle East my day begins at 6am as we must finish before the heat kicks in at
                        midday. I finish work at 3pm and have the remainder of the afternoon and evening off to do as I please. Working
                        here in Qatar allows me to have a more relaxed working environment and I have never brought work home.
                        My weekends are filled with fun exciting adventures from dune bashing and camping in the desert,
                        exploring the magnificent shopping malls and hotels and visiting places like the souq just for a relaxed evening with friends.
