        Every day starts differently as I progress on with
my pregnancy and changes to my daily routine. I’ll
wake up around 6.30 each morning, leave the
house at 7.15 to catch the 7.57 train from
Waterloo. I reach university for 8.45 when I’ll grab
a quick snack and drink before a full day of
lectures begin. The lectures are interesting as I
train to be a teacher but it can be difficult when the
tiredness and pregnancy symptoms play up. I
leave university around 4.30 and reach home for
6.15 after which I’ll get dinner ready for my
husband and his family. Prepare lunch for the next
and make sure everyone’s had a hot drink before
sleeping. I normally leave the kitchen around 8.30
once everything’s been cleared up. Will spend some time with my in laws followed by going to my room to get directed tasks from university
completed or then planning finished when I’m on placement. I’m not far from completing my
primary PGCE now and I’m excited to become a mother and teach other children soon after.</p>

This morning I got up at 6.00 and headed to the local pool for a morning swim.
I return home, shower, eat a quick breakfast and get on the train to make it to my first lecture at 9.00. I study Economics and Psychology, which I love as it gives me a real mix of
understanding how the economy works but also looking deeper at why people act in certain ways and participate in the economy. Todays topic looked at Tax Evasion, trying to understand why people evade and
 why people comply. My classes finished at 2.00, so I get back on the train and head to work, to start at 3. I work as a business administrator at a swim school, where I aide with the finances, timetable
  classes and communication with clients. I finish work at 7.00, get my self home for dinner, do a final bit of study before heading to bed ready for another day.

Today was a busy day, with the lead up to the first competitive athletic meet-up, training has doubled, and trying to fit in academic studies around training is becoming a struggle. To start the day,
I attended strength training at 6.00 with the whole athletics team from the University of North Carolina. After training, I attended my maths tutorial at 8.30 and maths lecture at 10. Over lunch we had a track
meeting, organising transport and accommodation for the weekend as well as receiving our race times. Last class for the day was Spanish at 3.00. Second training session started at 5.00 with the female track team.
Finishing off training with a stretch session run by the physio team. Dinner tonight was provided by the athletics team, including birthday cake for my team mate. By the end of the day I was knackered, climbing into
bed by 9.00 ready for tomorrow morning’s sprint session.

I left my hotel room that at around 7 am and took a taxi to the heliport. We were given the usual basic offshore survival and emergency training.
Then it was time to suit up in the heavy survival gear and shortly after that, we boarded the helicopter and took off.
I smiled in awe as the offshore rig came into view from my window and after landing, I headed to the reception and checked into my room.
I met up with my colleague who had been on board and discussed the job. There was a storm coming and drilling was postponed. With not much to do, I headed to the gym
for 45 minutes then met up with the team for a buffet lunch. I always love offshore food as its excellent and better than my cooking. The storm was now upon us and the
rig was swaying gently, we went to the cinema and watched a movie. Much sooner it was dinnertime and afterwards I relaxed on the massage chair for an hour and by 8pm,
I was in bed knowing that the next would be much busier after the storm. </p>

Summer is my favourite time of the year, this is partly because every summer I work for an amazing
organisation called “The Challenge”. It’s an organisation working with 16-18- year olds to build skills
for work and life whilst taking on new challenges. Kind of like a fun summer school, my role involved
managing groups of young people as they went through the programme. On this particular day, in
summer 2017, I got up extra early as we had planned a full day hike. We got ready, had breakfast,
packed our bags, collected our equipment, went over our route and set off on the hike just after
8:00am. The morning started off with beautiful clear blue skies, perfect water for the challenges we
had to do during our hike. However, just before reaching our campsite, the skies greyed up and we
were on a race against time to get our tents put up before we were all soaked. The rain lasted for a
good few hours, but it soon cleared into a double rainbow, overlooking the Somerset coastline. It was
just in time for us to cook our packet ready meal dinners, and around the fire, with our hot cholate and
marshmallows. It was perfect.</p>

  On a typical day of university, I try to wake up and grab some breakfast before heading to my lectures. I study Biomedical Science and have a mixture of lectures and lab classes centred around understanding biology and disease. Lab classes can be difficult as we are blending practical skills with our theory of the subject, but my friend and I always have fun while completing the work.
  After my classes I head home and do any catch-up work for the upcoming days. Every few weeks I volunteer for Anthony Nolan, a charity that signs people up to the stem cell register. This gives me the opportunity to go to different events and speak to people about how they can help save a life by donating their stem cells. In the evenings I go to fencing training to destress. Although
  I wasn’t sporty at all at school, I took up fencing as a beginner last year, and have been able to make great friends and play at university matches.</p>

                Sunday means family. Most Sunday’s my family – or who can make it – meet up for lunch. We take it in turns to host at each member’s house, but this week it’s at mine and Donald’s. I got up at 9am to put the potatoes on for the salad and nip to the shops to pick up the rest of the groceries.
                In the meantime, Donald is setting up the outdoor table for 10 as the weather is all sunshine today. When I return home I finish the apple and rhubarb crumble from the day before and get the meat in the oven. By 12.30 the family arrives and the food is ready to be served. There was so much
                excitement from the grandkids as they told me about their holiday to the south of France last week and it’s great seeing Phoebe finally able to crawl on her hands and knees. As 4.00 came it was, as always, so hard to say goodbye to my family but I know in seven days it will all happen again.
                I wrote this post today to remind everyone the importance of family, especially to us in the older generation.

My days blur into one: classes, placements, work, gym. But time is still when I'm chasing the sun; when it rises, when it sets.
The only miracle I witness that keeps the spark alight in my heart. Where am I in life right now? Still yearning to cross the seas, and escape
the buildings, the dullness, the monotony I have lived every day in this city, this town for the past 23 years. How is it when I look across the sea I feel
such peace and such contentment, but this odd feeling of my soul escaping me -this world is not where you belong. I'm going crazy and feeling this strange
serenity at once, trying to be present but not seeing the worth.
Snapping back to reality, I’m currently back at Jaguar temporarily, till I complete my second degree (South Asian parents don't ever seem to be satisfied),
and become a trainee lawyer. It's different this time around, I receive treatment that I did not have when I was there full time as part of the sales team.
My manager is like a different person, but of course, he is primarily a salesman, I can't forget that. It's amusing to remember when I would stare at him blankly,
as he would try to get through to me in his bursts of frustrations, and would get further frustrated with my blankness. It was good to see young James again, and
 hear him moaning about the workplace. Lovely and amazing George gifted me two books, which I am so grateful for, and very much looking forward to reading. I've
 got quite the stack of 'to-read' books now, but of course I have a mountain of Law textbooks that my head should be buried very deeply into, with no hope of coming out, ever.

                        midday. I finish work at 3pm and have the remainder of the afternoon and evening off to do as I please. Working
                        here in Qatar allows me to have a more relaxed working environment and I have never brought work home.
                        My weekends are filled with fun exciting adventures from dune bashing and camping in the desert,
                        exploring the magnificent shopping malls and hotels and visiting places like the souq just for a relaxed evening with friends.

                          Every day without fail, I roll out of bed, put on my trusty dressing gown and make my extra strong morning coffee. As I gradually become more awake and focused, I do my usual make up routine (winged eyeliner & mascara) in front of the mirror. Then I feel officially ready to face the day. Being a law student, I don’t usually have a huge number of lectures; however this is bridged by the intense amount of reading we get set per week. Thus most days are spent in the library, attempting to expand my knowledge on a subject that challenges me but that I love all the same. Yesterday I spent approximately 7 hours studying, and afterwards I met up with a work friend for a late night glass of wine. As I returned home fairly late (10:30pm), I took the easy option regarding my dinner and bought a microwaveable curry. Unfortunately, it was horrendously spicy, and being a girl with crazy-sensitive taste buds, I went to sleep without being able to feel my own tongue in my mouth. I like to read, so I fell asleep with a crime fiction novel in my hand.
